# Practical Exercises – Homework 4 (Computer Structure)

This folder contains my solutions to the **Practical Exercises** from Homework 4.

---

## Exercise 1 – Triangle Validity
Check if three given integers can form the sides of a valid triangle. Store `1` in `$t4` if valid, otherwise store `0`, without using branches or jumps.

---

## Exercise 2 – Number Ordering and Binary Representation
Take three integers as input, first print them in reverse order, then show their binary representation (6-bit). Must be implemented without branch or jump instructions.

---

## Exercise 3 – Binary and Hexadecimal Conversion
Read a 6-bit binary number and an integer. Convert the binary number to decimal and hexadecimal, and also print the decimal number back in both binary and hex.

---

## Exercise 4 – Multiplication and Division without Instructions
Implement multiplication and division operations without using built-in `mul`, `div`, or shift instructions. Use arithmetic logic to achieve the same functionality.

---

## Exercise 5 – Polynomial Evaluation
Read coefficients `a, b, c, d` and an input `x`. Compute the polynomial:  
f(x) = a·x³ + b·x² + c·x + d
and print the result as an integer.
