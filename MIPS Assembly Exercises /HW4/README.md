# Practical Exercises – Homework 6 (Computer Structure)

This folder contains my solutions to the **Practical Exercises** from Homework 6.

---

## Exercise 1 – Prefix Substring Repetitions
Write a program that, for each prefix of a string, counts how many times that prefix appears as a substring in the whole string. Print the counts line by line.

---

## Exercise 2 – Non-Consecutive Binary Numbers
Using recursion, generate and print all n-bit binary numbers that do not contain consecutive 1s, in descending order.

---

## Exercise 3 – Tak Function Simulation
Implement the recursive **TAK** function in MIPS, which is commonly used in algorithm analysis tests. It takes three integers and recursively evaluates based on conditional branches.

---

## Exercise 4 – Matrix Rotation
Read a 4×4 matrix stored as 16 bytes in memory and rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise. Store the rotated matrix back in memory.

---

## Exercise 5 – Palindrome Check with Recursion
Read an integer of up to 10 digits and use recursion to check whether it is a palindrome. Print **YES** if it is, otherwise **NO**.
