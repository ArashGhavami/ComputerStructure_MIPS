# Practical Exercises – Homework 5 (Computer Structure)

This folder contains my solutions to the **Practical Exercises** from Homework 5.

---

## Exercise 1 – Stack Machine Implementation
Simulate a simple stack machine with instructions like `psh`, `pop`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `ext`. Use dynamic memory (`sbrk`) instead of MIPS built-in stack.

---

## Exercise 2 – Recursive Power Calculation
Write a program to compute `a^b` (a raised to the power of b) using recursion with logarithmic complexity `O(log b)`.

---

## Exercise 3 – Relatively Prime Pairs in an Array
Read an array of length `n` and count how many pairs of numbers are relatively prime. Use Euclid’s algorithm for greatest common divisor (GCD).

---

## Exercise 4 – Bubble Sort
Read `n` integers, sort them in ascending order using bubble sort, and print the sorted array. Guarantee: `n ≤ 200`.

---

## Exercise 5 – Matrix Multiplication
Multiply an `N×M` matrix with an `M×P` matrix and store the result in memory. Input matrices are given in `.data` section.

---

## Exercise 6 – Armstrong Number Check
Check if an input integer (up to 8 digits) is an Armstrong number. Print **YES** if it is, otherwise **NO**.

---

## Exercise 7 – Polynomial Multiplication
Read two polynomials and compute their product. Print the resulting polynomial in standard form with coefficients and powers.
