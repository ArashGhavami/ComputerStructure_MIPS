# Practical Exercises – Homework 8 (IBM s390x Assembly)

This folder contains my solutions to the **Practical Exercises** from Homework 8.

---

## Exercise 1 – Running Square-Sum Check
Read `n`, then `n` integers. After each new number, output whether the running sum so far is a perfect square (YES/NO). 64-bit signed range is guaranteed.

---

## Exercise 2 – Sum of Digits in an Alphanumeric String
Given a mixed upper/lowercase English string, sum all decimal digits embedded in it and print the total (string length ≤ 100).

---

## Exercise 3 – Palindrome in Decimal and Binary
Read a decimal integer; print **YES** if the number is a palindrome in **both** decimal and binary forms, otherwise print **NO**.

---

## Exercise 4 – Shift-and-Add Multiplier
Implement an iterative “shift & add” multiplier: compute the product using minimal additions while maintaining a simple control/test structure.

---

## Exercise 5 – Longest Zero/One Runs in a Binary String
Given a binary string, output: (1) length of the longest contiguous run of `0`s, and (2) length of the longest contiguous run of `1`s.

---

## Exercise 6 – sum(int* arr, int n)
Implement `int sum(int* arr, int n)` in IBM s390x assembly using the platform’s calling convention; return the sum of the first `n` elements of `arr`.
