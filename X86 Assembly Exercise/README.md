# Practical Exercises – Homework 7 (x86 / 8086 Assembly)

This folder contains my solutions to the **Practical Exercises** from Homework 7, focusing on x86 and 8086 assembly programming.

---

## Exercise 1 – 8086 Instruction Set Simulation
Implement an 8086 assembly program that supports custom commands (`cmp`, `swap`, `mul`, `div`, `msb`, `lsb`, `overflow`, `exit`). The program takes numbers as input and performs arithmetic/bitwise tasks as defined.

---

## Exercise 2 – Longest Substring without Repeating Characters
Write an 8086 assembly program that reads a string and finds the longest substring without repeated characters. The program is case-insensitive.

---

## Exercise 3 – Alphabet Sorting of String Characters
Take a string as input and output its characters sorted in alphabetical order using 8086 assembly.

---

## Exercise 4 – String Comparison
Write an 8086 assembly program to compare two null-terminated strings (`string1` and `string2`) byte by byte and determine if they are equal or not.

---

## Exercise 5 – Count Zeros and Ones
Given a binary string (e.g., `"00011100"`), count how many `0`s and how many `1`s appear, and print both counts.
